node js It is different from other JavaScript environments because it is asynchronous and event-driven.
Google uses V8 for Node.js because it is faster and more efficient. It compiles the JavaScript code directly into machine code.
Node red is a visual programming tool for Node.js that is used to wire hardware devices and online services as part of IoT applications.
In such cases, the multiple thread options are better but they are sluggish in performance. Moreover, if a relational database is used with Node.js, it behaves strangely, preventing favorable outcomes that the users can be sure of. Since Node.js does not support multiple threads, it is better suited for lightweight applications but not large-scale or heavy applications
We use req.connection.remote address to get the IP address.


Exit code : Exit codes are a collection of specific codes whose function is to complete a specific process. Examples of exit codes are fatal error, unused, internal JavaScript evaluation failure, etc.

Dependencies are present in the package.json file.
There are three layers in the application architecture - API, service, and integration layers.
Two input arguments for asynchronous queue are concurrency value and task function.
It is possible to run external processes with Node.js. This can be done with the help of the child_process module.

27.
How does Node.js handle concurrency if it is single-threaded?
Node.js prevents bottlenecks and aids programmers in easily writing the code because of the single-thread model. Internally, there are several POSIX threads for different I/O operations like File, DNS, etc.

So, when Node receives an I/O request, it uses one of these threads for the I/O operation. Once the operation is complete, the result joins the event queue. Because of the event mechanism, the event loop starts after each event, checks the queue, and if Node’s execution stack is free, then the loop adds the queue result to it, thus managing concurrency.
The emit() function is used to fire an event.

Error-first callbacks are used to pass data and identify if an error has occurred.

Libuv is a library that provides an event loop and a thread pool for handling asynchronous operations seamlessly. It helps in handling file systems, child processes, files, DNS, etc.
Punycode is a way of encoding internationalized domain names that use characters outside of the ASCII range.

 Traditionally on the web, we had a request/response format where a user sends an HTTP request and the server responds to that. This is still applicable in most cases, especially those using RESTful API. But a need was felt for the server to also communicate with the client, without getting polled(or requested) by the client. The server in itself should be able to send information to the client or the browser. This is where Web Socket comes into the picture.
 6. What is Callback hell? How can you avoid them?
A problematic phenomenon for a JavaScript developer when he tries to execute multiple asynchronous operations consecutively is termed callback hell. An asynchronous function is one that requires some external activity completion before processing a result. These asynchronous functions require a callback function to tackle errors and process the result.


Spawned Child Processes
The spawn function launches a command in a new process and we can use it to pass that command any arguments. For example, here’s code to spawn a new process that will execute the pwd command.
